## 📌 Introduction

This repository contains solutions to a series of basic programming problems designed to strengthen fundamental skills in C programming. Each program is crafted to solve a specific problem, building a foundation in programming logic, loops, conditionals, and data handling in C. 
This repository is part of my college coursework assignment, aiming to solidify my understanding of these core concepts.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codeIntrovert/C.git
   cd c
   ```

2. **Compile the C files** using a C compiler, such as `gcc`:

   ```bash
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name
   ```

3. **Run the compiled program**:

   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```

Replace `program_name` with the actual file name, e.g., `reverse_number.c`.
